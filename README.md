🤖 Companion Robot with Smart Reminders and Voice Assistant
This is a Final Year Project (FYP) developed using Python and Streamlit. It functions as a voice-enabled companion that can engage in natural conversations, detect user emotions, understand English/Urdu, and schedule intelligent voice-based reminders.

🎓 Final Year Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of modern AI and NLP technologies to build a responsive Companion Robot. It combines:

Natural Language Understanding
Speech Recognition and Synthesis
Emotion Detection
Bilingual Communication (English & Urdu)
Voice-based Smart Reminders
💡 Key Features
🎙️ Voice Interaction: Use your microphone to talk naturally
😊 Emotion Detection: Understands and reacts to emotional tone
🌐 Bilingual Support: English and Urdu (auto-detection and translation)
🔁 Conversational Memory: Maintains chat context across turns
⏰ Reminder System:
Set reminders using natural language (e.g., "Remind me in 10 minutes")
Also supports manual time selection
Uses voice alerts and optional alarm sounds
🎛️ Microphone Selection: Choose input device from the sidebar
